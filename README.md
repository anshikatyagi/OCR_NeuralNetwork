# OCR_NeuralNetwork
The input layer consists of images where RGB values are extracted to give each pixel a numerical value. Therefore, input neurons are equal to the number of pixels in the image(used 8*8 pixel).
The output neurons are 10, to detect numbers from 0-9.
One hidden layer included, could be improved by increasing the number of hidden layers but this in turn requires alot of computational power 
Transformed the input into single array,
